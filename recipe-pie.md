#### DIRECTIONS

* Leave your pastry to thaw out overnight to soften before using.
* Preheat your oven to 200 degrees C.
* Peel and finely dice your leek, use both white and green of the leek ensuring to give the insides a good wash.
* Chop the broccoli and celeriac into bite sized pieces.

##### TO BLIND BAKE THE PASTRY

  * Grease the pie dish by adding 1 tbsp of oil and spread around so the pastry doesn't stick. 
  * Roll out 1 sheet of pastry to fit the pie dish, ensuring the pastry comes up the edges and slightly over the edges so it won’t fall back down when it bakes. 
  * Cover with baking parchment and weigh it down with dried beans (approx 200g). 
  * Bake at 200 degrees celsius for 15 mins, take out, remove the baking parchment and dried beans and set aside and leave to cool.

##### PIE FILLING

1. __first step is to make a béchamel sauce. __
	* Put a medium saucepan on medium heat. 
	* Add the 4 tbsp of oil and sieve in 4 tbsp of flour and using a whisk stir for 1 minute. 
	* Slowly add the 700ml of oat milk, turn the heat up high, and bring to the boil stirring very regularly. 
	* Once boiling reduce the heat to a simmer and once the sauce is starting to thicken nicely take it off the heat. 
	* Add the garlic powder, onion powder, pinch black pepper, pinch of salt, juice and zest of half lemon and 1 tbsp of dijon mustard and mix in well. 
	* Leave and set aside too cool.

2. __second step is to make the filling.__
	* Heat a large sauce pan to high heat. 
	* Add 1 tbsp of oil, along with the chopped leek and celeriac and cook on medium heat for 4 mins until they start to slightly brown. 
	* Add a generous pinch of salt and the chopped broccoli, stir well and put the lid on and leave to sweat for 10-15 mins stirring occasionally until the veg is soft and cooked. 
	* Once the veg is cooked add the bechemel sauce. 
	* Taste the sauce and veg and adjust the seasonings to your pallet by adding more salt or lemon juice if needed. 
	* Add the sauce and veg to the blind baked pie base until it comes to almost the top.

3. __third step is to put everything in the right place.__
	* Roll out the remaining sheet of pastry to fit the top of the pie dish and gently fit it on. 
	* Use a fork to join the 2 sheets of pastry and to seal the pie. 
	* Make a hole in the pastry using a fork at the top to allow extra moisture to release. 
	* Using a pastry brush, brush on 30ml of oat milk or non dairy milk of choice on top of the pastry, this will help the pastry to golden up. 
	* Bake in a preheated oven at 200 degrees C for 15-20 mins until the pastry is nice and golden. 

4. __Serve and enjoy!__
